## Boris Bikes Challenge 

We all are familiar with the London's Santander Cycles, it allows anyone to hire a bike and ride it around London.

Our aim for the project is to build a bike system that has a network of docking stations and bikes that anyone can use. We will build a program that will emulate all the docking stations, bikes, and infrastructure.

This project will include 22 challenges.
